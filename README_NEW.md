# C-programming-codes (expanded)

Collection of basic C programs used for learning and practice. This repository contains small examples and exercises (arrays, pointers, recursion, sorting, file I/O, etc.).

## How to build

Using GCC (MinGW-w64) on Windows:

```powershell
gcc -o program.exe filename.c
```

To compile a single example and run it:

```powershell
gcc -o 01_first.exe 01_first.c
./01_first.exe
```

## Contributing

Add new exercises or improve existing ones. Keep filenames descriptive.

## Notes

This project includes a `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts and IDE settings.
